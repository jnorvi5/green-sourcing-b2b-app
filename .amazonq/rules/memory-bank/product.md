# GreenChainz - B2B Green Sourcing Marketplace

## Project Purpose
GreenChainz is a data-driven B2B marketplace connecting sustainability-minded buyers (architects, contractors, procurement teams) with verified green suppliers. The platform aggregates, standardizes, and presents Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), certifications, and carbon footprints in a single, trusted platform.

## Core Value Proposition
**Data Moat**: Verifiable sustainability data aggregated from multiple sources (EPD International, WAP Sustainability, Building Transparency, Autodesk, FSC) providing "apples-to-apples" comparisons for green materials.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### For Buyers (Architects, Contractors, Procurement Teams)
- **Product Discovery**: Search and filter sustainable building materials with verified EPDs
- **Sustainability Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of carbon footprints and certifications
- **RFQ System**: Request for Quote functionality with automated supplier matching
- **Verification Scores**: Proprietary scoring system for supplier sustainability credentials
- **Dashboard**: Track RFQ history, saved products, and procurement analytics

### For Suppliers (Material Manufacturers)
- **Product Management**: Upload and manage product catalogs with sustainability data
- **Quote Management**: Respond to RFQs with integrated pricing and availability
- **Verification System**: Multi-tier verification (B-Corp, FSC, EC3 integration)
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track product views, RFQ responses, and market insights
- **White-glove Onboarding**: Tiered integration (API, file upload, manual entry)

### Platform Features
- **Multi-channel Authentication**: OAuth integration (Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft)
- **Email Automation**: Transactional emails for RFQs, approvals, and notifications
- **Admin Console**: Content moderation, supplier approval, and platform analytics
- **API-first Architecture**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation
- **Real-time Updates**: Live notifications and status tracking

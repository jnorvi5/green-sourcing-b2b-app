# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: This workflow is DISABLED and should be removed
# 
# REASON: This workflow attempts to deploy to an Azure Function App named 
# 'greenchainz-scraper', but the actual architecture uses Azure Container Apps
# exclusively (greenchainz-frontend and greenchainz-container).
#
# NO FUNCTION APP CODE EXISTS: The repository does not contain Azure Functions
# code (no host.json, local.settings.json, or functions directory).
#
# CORRECT DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW: Use .github/workflows/deploy-azure-cd.yml
# which deploys to Container Apps (greenchainz-frontend and greenchainz-container).
#
# ACTION REQUIRED: Delete this file or verify if a Function App resource 
# actually exists and is intended to be deployed.
#
# See AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCES.md for complete architecture documentation.

# Copilot Custom Code Review Instructions

## Objective
- Review the entire repo for code, configuration, and deployment errors.
- Focus on paths, imports, logo/branding issues, missing exports, and reasons why frontend changes might not appear in production.
- Suggest exact code or config fixes as diffs.

## Steps Copilot Should Do:
1. Index all TypeScript, JavaScript, asset, and config files in this workspace.
2. Flag any unresolved imports, missing or outdated assets (logo, images).
3. Identify stale or unused files.
4. Analyze routing to ensure new components are accessible.
5. Highlight build/deploy misconfigurations, including Vercel/GitHub workflow settings.
6. Write a prioritized report with checklists and diffs.

## Output
- Write a report as CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md in the root folder.
- Suggest terminal commands for me to test or deploy the fixes.
- If possible, create scripts/tasks to automate fixing the common issues.

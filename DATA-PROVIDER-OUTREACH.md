## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Template A: Free Data Partnership (EC3, Autodesk)

**Subject:** Partnership: [Your Company] Data + GreenChainz Marketplace

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm building GreenChainz, a B2B marketplace for sustainable materials targeting SMB architects.

I saw your work on [SPECIFIC FEATURE FROM MIND MAP]:
- EC3: 250K+ free EPDs for Embodied Carbon
- Autodesk Tandem: 15% energy reduction with Digital Twin + IoT

**My ask:** Can we integrate your data via API? 

**What you get:**
✅ Every product listing links back to your source (attribution + SEO)
✅ Qualified architect traffic (we pre-filter by project type)
✅ Co-marketing: "Powered by [Your Company]" badge on our site

**Why partner:**
Your Mind Map insight: "BIM data often not usable without common standards."

We solve this by normalizing EPDs at the marketplace layer → Architects get simple interface, you get adoption.

**Market timing:**
- Green building: $471B → $1T+ (9.75-12.4% CAGR)
- Regulatory push: Nordic Programme (2021-2024) proves government backing
- Gap: Architects need simpler tools than SimaPro, more transactional than EC3

15-min call this week to discuss integration?

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, GreenChainz

**My ask:** Database licensing or API partnership (paid)

**Non-competitive positioning:**

We're the simplified front-end for your expert-level data. Architect discovers materials on GreenChainz → Needs advanced LCA → Upgrades to [Your Company].

## 🔄 FOLLOW-UP CADENCE

### Email 1 (Day 0): Initial outreach
Use Template A or B

### Email 2 (Day 4): Soft follow-up
**Subject:** Re: Partnership: [Your Company] Data + GreenChainz

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from [Day]. 

Quick question: Is API integration something you'd consider? Or is there a better contact on your team?

Happy to send a quick Loom video showing how we'd integrate your data if that's easier.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Email 3 (Day 8): Value-add follow-up
**Subject:** Re: Partnership - Architect Traffic Data

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I know you're busy. Wanted to share some data that might be relevant:

Our early testing shows:
- 60% of architects search by LEED credit first (not product name)
- Top filter: "Recycled content %" (not just yes/no certification)
- Pain point: "Can't find EPD data during design phase" (your data solves this)

This is exactly why integrating [Your Company] data would be valuable. 

Still interested? Let me know if a 10-min call works.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Email 4 (Day 15): Final outreach
**Subject:** Re: Partnership - Closing this thread

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'll take the silence as a "not right now" and close this thread.

If anything changes, feel free to reach out. We're moving forward with [EC3 / other partner], so if you'd like to revisit in 3-6 months, let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## 🚨 RED FLAGS (When to Pivot)

### If 0 responses after 10 emails (by Nov 23):
**Possible causes:**
1. Email going to spam (test with Mailtrack)
2. Wrong contact (find BizDev lead, not CEO)
3. Pitch unclear (simplify to 3 sentences)

**Fix:**
- LinkedIn cold outreach instead (more personal)
- Warm intro via mutual connection (check LinkedIn 2nd connections)
- Attend conference: Greenbuild 2025 (Dec 2-5, Las Vegas) → In-person pitches

### If all say "Not interested":
**Possible causes:**
1. No clear value prop ("What's in it for me?")
2. Asking for too much upfront (skip API, start with CSV export)
3. Competitive threat (they see you as rival, not partner)

**Fix:**
- Start smaller: "Can we use your public data with attribution?"
- Offer revenue share: "We'll pay per query"
- Position as channel: "We're your SMB sales team"

---

## 📚 RESEARCH BEFORE EMAILING

### For Each Target Company:
1. **LinkedIn Research (10 min):**
   - Find BizDev/Partnerships contact (not CEO)
   - Check recent posts (mention their work in email)
   - Look for mutual connections (warm intro opportunity)

2. **Website Research (5 min):**
   - Read "Partners" page (who do they already work with?)
   - Check API documentation (is integration feasible?)
   - Look for case studies (what problems do they solve?)

3. **Competitor Research (5 min):**
   - Google: "[Company] + partnerships"
   - Check if they partner with similar marketplaces
   - Example: "EC3 partners with Autodesk" → Good signal they're open

## 🎤 ELEVATOR PITCH (For Calls)

**Version 1: Technical Audience (EC3, Autodesk)**

**Version 2: Business Audience (One Click LCA, SimaPro)**
> "GreenChainz targets the 70% of architects your enterprise tools miss - small firms under 50 employees. We're the simplified front-end for your expert-level data. Non-competitive: We drive qualified leads to your paid tiers."

**Version 3: Certification Bodies (FSC, LEED)**
> "GreenChainz is a verified materials marketplace. Architects filter by your certification (FSC, LEED), we show only certified products, they buy directly from suppliers. You get more adoption, suppliers get more sales."

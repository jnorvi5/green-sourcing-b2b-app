## 📧 Email Templates

### Supplier Outreach Email (Founding 50)

**Subject:** GreenChainz Founding 50 - Free Premium Access (Year 1)

---

Hi [First Name],

I'm building **GreenChainz** - a B2B marketplace connecting architects with verified sustainable material suppliers. We're solving a $77B problem: architects spend 32+ hours per project hunting for sustainable materials, and suppliers like [Company Name] struggle to reach qualified specifiers.

**We're inviting the first 50 suppliers to our "Founding 50" program:**

✅ Free Premium tier for Year 1 ($5,988 value)  
✅ Gold "Founding 50" badge (prestige positioning)  
✅ Access to group certification discounts (40% off FSC, B Corp)  
✅ Direct access to 100+ architects (our beta waitlist)  
✅ Featured in launch PR (GreenBiz, ArchDaily)

**Your profile would include:**
- Product catalog with verified eco-metrics
- RFQ inbox (architects send quotes directly to you)
- Analytics dashboard (views, clicks, conversions)
- Network message board (connect with architects + peers)

**Why you?** [Specific reason: saw your FSC certification, impressed by carbon-negative claim, etc.]

**Already signed:** 42 suppliers including [drop names if relevant]

**Next step:** 15-min call to show you the platform?  
[Calendly link]

**Questions?** Reply to this email or call me: [Your phone]

Best,  
[Your Name]  
Founder, GreenChainz  
greenchainz.com

P.S. The Founding 50 closes when we hit 50 suppliers (currently at 42). After that, Premium is $499/mo.

---

### Architect Survey Email

**Subject:** 2-min survey: What's your biggest pain point sourcing sustainable materials?

---

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much time do you spend researching sustainable materials for each project?

I'm [Your Name], building **GreenChainz** - a search engine for verified sustainable building products. We're surveying 100 architects to understand your biggest pain points before we launch the beta.

**The survey takes 2 minutes:**  
[Survey link: /surveys/buyer]

**As a thank you:**
- Early beta access (launching Month 4)
- Your input shapes the product roadmap
- Entry to win $500 Amazon gift card (1 winner)

**Already heard from:** 247 architects. Top pain point so far: "Too much time wasted on greenwashing claims."

**Why you?** [Specific reason: saw your LEED project, noticed you specified FSC materials on X project, etc.]

Thanks for helping us build something you'll actually use.

Best,  
[Your Name]  
Founder, GreenChainz  
greenchainz.com

P.S. Want to see a sneak peek of the platform? Reply "demo" and I'll send you a 90-second video.

### Data Provider Partnership Email

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity: Integrate [Provider Name] data into GreenChainz marketplace

---

Hi [Contact Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of **GreenChainz** - a B2B marketplace connecting architects with sustainable material suppliers. We're integrating verified data from leading certification bodies to combat greenwashing.

**Our users need access to your data:**
- 100+ architects in our beta waitlist ask daily about [FSC/B Corp/EC3/etc] verification
- 42 suppliers want to display their [certifications] on product pages
- We're embedding real-time cert checking into our RFQ workflow

**Partnership proposal:**
1. **Free API access** for GreenChainz (startup tier)
2. **Co-marketing:** We promote [Provider Name] certification to our supplier network
3. **Data feedback loop:** Supplier corrections improve your database accuracy
4. **Revenue share (optional):** If we sell enterprise API access, you get 20%

**Example integration:**
- Supplier uploads product → We auto-check [Provider Name] API → Display verified badge
- Architect filters by "[Certification]" → Only verified products appear
- Blockchain audit trail (Phase 2) → Immutable cert verification history

**Similar partnerships:** Building Transparency (EC3 data), FSC (forest cert checking)

**Next step:** 20-min call to discuss API access?  
[Calendly link]

**Questions?** Reply here or call: [Your phone]

Best,  
[Your Name]  
Founder, GreenChainz  
greenchainz.com

P.S. Here's our MOU template: [Google Docs link]. Happy to customize.

## 📞 Cold Call Script (Suppliers)

**Opening:**
> Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from GreenChainz. Do you have 90 seconds? I'm calling because we're launching a marketplace for sustainable building materials, and I think [Company Name] would be a perfect fit for our "Founding 50" program.

**Qualification:**
> Quick question: How are you currently reaching architects who specify [product type]? [Listen]

**Value Prop:**
> Here's the thing - we've surveyed 247 architects, and 89% say they spend too much time hunting for sustainable materials. We're building a search engine where they can compare products by carbon footprint, certifications, price, and lead time - all in one place.

> The Founding 50 program gives you free Premium access for Year 1 (normally $499/mo), a gold badge that shows you're an early adopter, and access to group certification discounts - we're negotiating 40% off FSC and B Corp through bulk processing.

**Objection Handling:**

*"We don't have budget for another platform"*
> That's why we're doing Founding 50 - it's free for Year 1. No credit card, no contract. The only ask is feedback to help us build features you actually need.

*"We already have enough leads"*
> I hear you. This isn't about volume - it's about qualified leads. Our architects are actively searching for [product type] with [specific certifications]. They send RFQs directly through the platform, so you know they're serious.

*"How do I know this will work?"*
> Fair question. We've already signed 42 suppliers, and we have 100 architects on our beta waitlist. I can send you a demo video (90 seconds) and customer testimonials. Want me to email that?

**Close:**
> Can I send you an invite to the platform? I'll include the Founding 50 terms and a quick demo. If you like it, we'll schedule a 15-min onboarding call. If not, no worries - but spots are filling up fast (we're at 42 of 50).

# WAP Sustainability Re-Engagement Email

**Subject:** Re: Partnership Opportunity | GreenChainz Beta is Live (30 Suppliers, 100 Architects)

Hi [WAP Contact Name],

First off, sincere apologies for the radio silence on my end. The team and I have been heads-down building, and the focus has paid off—I'm excited to share that **GreenChainz is now live in beta.**

Since we last spoke, we've onboarded:
*   **30 Founding Suppliers**
*   **100 Architect Users** actively looking for verified green materials.

We are currently aggregating EPD data from multiple sources to power our marketplace, and we still view WAP Sustainability as a critical partner in this ecosystem.

**Our Value Proposition for WAP:**
Our model focuses on driving demand for LCA certifications among the "long tail" of small-to-mid-sized contractors and suppliers who often find platforms like SimaPro or One Click LCA out of reach. By partnering with GreenChainz, you gain access to a new pipeline of customers who need your certification services to compete on our marketplace.

I've attached a **1-page overview** detailing our current traction and the specific mechanics of our proposed referral partnership.

Can we schedule a brief call this week to discuss how we can formalize this?

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Founder, GreenChainz

### **GreenChainz: The Marketplace for Verified Green Building Materials**

**Current Traction (Beta Phase):**
*   **Live Beta:** Platform is operational and facilitating material discovery.
*   **User Base:** 100+ Architects & Specifiers, 30+ Founding Suppliers.
*   **Data Aggregation:** Centralizing EPDs and sustainability certifications to simplify procurement.

**The Market Gap:**
Small and medium-sized contractors often lack the budget and technical expertise for enterprise-grade LCA tools. However, market pressure demands they provide certified green materials.

**The Partnership Opportunity:**
GreenChainz acts as the bridge.
1.  **Demand Generation:** We identify suppliers on our platform who need EPDs/LCA verification to boost their visibility and sales.
2.  **Referral Pipeline:** We refer these high-intent leads directly to WAP Sustainability for certification services.
3.  **Data Integration:** WAP-certified products get "Verified" badges and priority placement in GreenChainz search results, closing the loop.

**Why Partner Now?**
*   **Early Mover Advantage:** Establish WAP as the preferred certifier for our growing network.
*   **Volume:** Access a high-volume, lower-touch customer segment through our aggregation.

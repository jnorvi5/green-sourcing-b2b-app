**Email Body (Customize per provider)**:

Dear [Provider Name] Team,

My name is [Your Name], and I'm the founder of **GreenChainz**, a B2B marketplace focused on verified sustainability data for green building materials and sustainable products.

**Our Mission**: We're building a centralized platform that connects sustainability-conscious architects, contractors, and procurement teams with verified green suppliers. Our core differentiator is making sustainability data—EPDs, certifications, and carbon footprints—transparent, standardized, and comparable in one trusted marketplace.

**Why We're Reaching Out**:  
Your [specific data type: e.g., "EPD database" / "Scope 3 emissions data" / "certification repository"] is a critical component of our data strategy. We aim to integrate verified, third-party sustainability data directly into our product catalog to enable buyers to:
- Compare products on verified GWP (Global Warming Potential) metrics
- Filter by certifications (FSC, LEED, etc.)
- Make data-driven, de-risked sourcing decisions

**Our Ask**:
- **API Access**: Information on developer/commercial API access (or bulk data licensing if applicable)
- **Partnership Terms**: Startup pricing or partnership programs (if available)
- **Technical Documentation**: Integration guides or sample data formats

**Our Tech Stack**:  
We're building on a modern, API-first architecture (Vercel frontend, Supabase backend, hybrid SQL/NoSQL database), designed for scalability and real-time data integration.

**Timeline**: We're in MVP development and targeting our first data integrations within the next 4-6 weeks.

Would you be available for a brief call to discuss partnership possibilities? I'd also welcome any documentation on API access or data licensing you can share.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to exploring how we can work together to advance transparency in sustainable sourcing.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
Founder, GreenChainz

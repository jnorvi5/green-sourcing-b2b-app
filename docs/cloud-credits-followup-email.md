# Cloud Credits Follow-Up Email Template

**Subject**: Following Up: Cloud Credits Application Status - GreenChainz

Dear [AWS Activate / Google Cloud for Startups] Team,

I'm following up on my cloud credits application submitted on [Date You Applied]. I'm building **GreenChainz**, a B2B green sourcing marketplace focused on verified sustainability data for the construction industry.

**Application Details**:
- **Company Name**: GreenChainz (or your registered name)
- **Project**: B2B sustainability platform (Azure Container Apps, Azure PostgreSQL, Azure OpenAI)
- **Use Case**: Hosting containerized services, database, AI-powered sustainability data processing

I'm currently in MVP development and planning my deployment architecture. Knowing the status of my credits application would help me finalize our hosting strategy.

**Questions**:
1. What is the current status of my application?
2. Is there any additional information needed from me to expedite approval?
3. If approved, what are the next steps to activate the credits?

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
Founder, GreenChainz  
[Your Email]

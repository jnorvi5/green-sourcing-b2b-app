## 2. Sponsorship Pitch Email

**Subject:** Sponsorship: GreenChainz beta access for [Chapter Name] members (Feb sustainability event?)

**Body:**

Dear [Name/Committee Chair],

I’m writing to explore sponsoring an upcoming [Chapter Name] Committee on the Environment (COTE) event in Q1 2026 (targeting February).

I’m the founder of **GreenChainz**, the first verified green materials marketplace designed to help architects drastically reduce research time for LEED/WELL projects. We are launching our beta in early 2026 and want to support the communities leading the charge in sustainable design.

**Our Proposal:**
We would love to sponsor your [specific upcoming event, e.g., February COTE meeting/workshop] (contribution: $500–$1,000, depending on your tiers) in exchange for:
1.  **5-minute intro:** Briefly introducing GreenChainz to your members.
2.  **Early Access:** Offering your attendees exclusive "Founding Member" access to our beta platform.
3.  **Newsletter Mention:** A brief shout-out in your chapter newsletter.

Our goal is to give your members a tool that simplifies their workflow, not just sell a product. We are already aggregating data from partners like EPD International and FSC.

Could you let me know if you have sponsorship slots open for February or March?

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Founder, GreenChainz

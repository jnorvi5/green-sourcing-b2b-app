**GreenChainz Launches First Trust Layer for Sustainable Building Materials, Backed by EPD International and Building Transparency**

**SAN FRANCISCO — [Date]** — GreenChainz today announced the public launch of its verified B2B marketplace, designed to solve the critical data fragmentation issue in the $471 billion green building materials market. By integrating directly with global certification bodies, GreenChainz provides a unified "trust layer" that allows architects, contractors, and developers to discover, verify, and source low-carbon materials, eliminating the manual verification bottlenecks that currently stall sustainable construction.

"Architects currently waste an average of 15 hours per project simply hunting for valid sustainability data and Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs)," said [Founder Name], Founder and CEO of GreenChainz. "We are fixing that inefficiency. By digitizing the verification process, we are ensuring that high-performance, low-carbon materials are no longer just theoretical options, but the easiest, most logical choice for every specification."

The platform aggregates data from recognized bodies to ensure that every product listing is backed by verified third-party documentation.

"Transparency is the currency of the future construction industry," said [Name], [Title] at [Partner Organization]. "Integrating with GreenChainz allows us to expand the access of verified environmental data beyond major firms to the small and mid-sized contractors who drive the bulk of construction volume, closing a critical gap in the supply chain."

The launch arrives as the industry faces mounting pressure from regulatory tailwinds, including federal 'Buy Clean' legislation and stricter LEED v4.1 mandates. As embodied carbon reporting shifts from voluntary to mandatory in key jurisdictions, the ability to rapidly validate Global Warming Potential (GWP) figures is transitioning from a competitive advantage to a compliance necessity.

During its closed beta phase, GreenChainz successfully onboarded 50 verified suppliers and over 200 architects, facilitating the specification of materials ranging from carbon-sequestering concrete to bio-based insulation.

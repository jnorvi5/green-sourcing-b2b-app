# Azure Development Rules

We are coding a b2b global trust layer for sustainable procurement. Our site helps the architects or decision makers whoever that may be make choices based on the viability of its eco friendly attributes. Our gold standard is recognized third party certifications. We have a tool that works right on Revit that is part of another repo but connects to this site that allows the architect to see his materials in real time and how well he is doing on a sustainability level. We have partnerships with Autodesk and Building Transparency that gives us access to its data and on the Autodesk side we have access to all its software to play with and see what we can come up with. The main site which is this one is going to be a marketplace and RFQ generator, we get paid off generated RFQ's and a subscription model for the suppliers who get better access and better RFQ's. No other site is really completing the whole process we are big on the buyer side there are big companies on the data side but they just lay it out their way instead of cleaning it up and making it easier to digest and turn into purchases. We are going to be like Procore for sustainability. The UI is going to be like Sweets it's going to list all the materials then when the architects want an RFQ it uses a location based method and certification algorithm to give them a few choices based on location and it will give them a scorecard that is sustainability focused with LEED scores and EPDs, etc. The branding is a leaf with a chain for the logo and all different shades of green and sleek with all the hover effects and glass looking it is beautiful and sexy a site that just melts your mind.

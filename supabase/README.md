# GreenChainz MVP Database Schema

This directory contains the PostgreSQL schema for the GreenChainz MVP, designed for Supabase.

## Files

- `schema.sql`: The idempotent SQL script to create all necessary tables, types, and indexes.

## Execution Instructions

To apply this schema to your Supabase project:

1.  **Navigate to the SQL Editor** in your Supabase project dashboard.
2.  **Open `schema.sql`** in a text editor and copy its entire contents.
3.  **Paste the script** into the Supabase SQL Editor.
4.  **Click "Run"** to execute the script.

The script is idempotent, meaning you can run it multiple times without causing errors or creating duplicate objects.

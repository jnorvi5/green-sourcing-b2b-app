# Cold Email Template: "The Correction" Strategy

**Strategy:** The best way to get a reply is to be slightly wrong (Cunningham's Law).
**Context:** Use this for manufacturers where you have found their EPD data but want to start a conversation by asking them to "correct" or "verify" it.
**Goal:** elicit a "No, actually it's..." or "Yes, that's correct, but..." response, which opens the door for the Founding 50 pitch.

**Subject:** Question about [Product Name] GWP data

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I was reviewing your EPDs on the International Registry for GreenChainz, our new material verification platform for architects.

I noticed the Global Warming Potential (GWP) for [Product Name] is listed as [Number] kg CO2e, but that figure looks potentially outdated compared to your recent sustainability reports.

Could you take a quick look? I want to make sure architects see the most competitive numbers when we launch the "Founding 50" showcase next month.

Here is the link to your draft profile: [Link to Profile or Placeholder]

Best,

[Your Name]

## Usage Notes

*   **[Product Name]:** Be specific. E.g., "EcoBatt Insulation R-13".
*   **[Number]:** Use the actual number you found.
*   **"Outdated":** This is the hook. Even if it *is* the current number, asking if it's outdated flatters them (implies their tech is improving) and prompts them to check.
*   **"Draft Profile":** If you don't have a real profile link yet, say "I can send over a screenshot of how it appears in the search results."

# LinkedIn Post: Announcing the Founding 50 Program

**Headline:** 🚀 We're hand-selecting the 50 suppliers who will define the future of green procurement.

**Body:**

Architects are tired of greenwashing. They want verified, data-backed sustainable materials, and they want them fast.

That’s why we’re building GreenChainz—the first verified B2B marketplace for sustainable construction materials.

But a marketplace is only as good as its partners.

Today, we are opening applications for our **"Founding 50" Program**.

We are looking for 50 visionary manufacturers who are leading the charge in sustainability—from mass timber to carbon-negative concrete—to join us as launch partners.

**By joining the Founding 50, you unlock lifetime benefits that will never be offered again:**

💎 **Lifetime Founding Badge:** Permanent status as a platform pioneer.
💰 **Zero Fees for 6 Months:** No commissions, no lead fees. Keep 100% of your revenue.
🚀 **Priority Search Placement:** Get seen first by architects and contractors.
🛠️ **Direct Input:** Shape the platform features to fit your sales needs.

**The catch? There are only 50 spots.**
And once they’re filled, they’re gone.

If you manufacture verified sustainable building materials and want to be at the forefront of digital procurement, we want you.

📅 **Application Deadline:** December 15th
🎯 **Goal:** 30 confirmed suppliers by Jan 1.

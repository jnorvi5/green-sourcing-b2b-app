## Email 1: The "Quick Question" (3 Days Later)

**Subject:** Re: Invitation: Join the "Founding 50" Sustainable Manufacturers (GreenChainz)

Hi [Name],

I wanted to quickly bump this up to see if you had a chance to review the "Founding 50" invitation.

We've already started reviewing applications from manufacturers in the [Category] space, but I really believe [Company Name] should be represented in this initial cohort given your work with [Specific Product/Cert].

The program creates a direct, verified channel to architects who are actively looking for materials like yours—without the noise of unverified competitors.

**Application Link:** [Link to greenchainz.com/founding-50]

Do you have 5 minutes for a brief call on Thursday or Friday to discuss?

Best,

[Your Name]

## Email 2: The Value Add / FOMO (1 Week Later)

**Subject:** 38 spots left: GreenChainz Founding 50

Hi [Name],

I wanted to give you a quick update—we've filled 12 of the 50 spots for our Founding Supplier cohort, and we're seeing strong interest from architects who are eager to use the platform for their upcoming Q1 projects.

I don't want [Company Name] to miss out on the **Lifetime Founding Badge** and the **6 months of zero fees**. These benefits are exclusive to this first group and won't be offered again.

We are specifically looking to finalize our [Category, e.g., Flooring] partners by next week.

Can we get [Company Name] on board before the December 15th deadline?

**Apply here in 2 minutes:** [Link to greenchainz.com/founding-50]

Cheers,

[Your Name]

## Email 3: The "Final Call" (2 Weeks Later / 3 Days Before Deadline)

**Subject:** Last call for Founding 50 (Deadline: Dec 15)

Hi [Name],

This is my last note regarding the GreenChainz Founding 50 program.

Applications close this **Friday, December 15th**.

We're finalizing the list of suppliers that will be presented to our network of architects for the platform launch. I'd love to include [Company Name] as a verified partner.

If the timing isn't right, I completely understand, and I won't reach out about this again. But if you've been meaning to apply, now is the time.

**Secure your spot here:** [Link to greenchainz.com/founding-50]

Hope to see you on the platform.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Founder, GreenChainz
